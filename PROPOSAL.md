# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Ike Holzmann** 


**Project Name: Parksy** 


**Is your project New or Old?: New**


**Is your project Solo or Team?: Solo**


## Description

Parksy is a parking rental platform that allows landowners to sell parking, and parking seekers to find a convenient parking spot near an event. What I hope to acheive during this intensive is a live web app that allows one to create an account, list their parking availability, make a sale for that parking space, and generate a PDF with a QR ticket for the customer. As a current assisting developer at a Wisconsin-based [ticketing platform](https://hometowntickets.com/), I can better understand how to generate such QR tickets by viewing our project's code. 

## Challenges I Anticipate

One challenge I anticipate while developing Parksy is allowing a renter to offer specific time slots for each parking space. 

## Skateboard

Mock parking space data, basic UI for renter CRUD, ability to rent a space anywhere with only license plate, location, and duration.

## Bike

Implement Stripe, clean UI.

## Car

UI for sorting parking spaces by location.

## Personal Achievement Goals:

- Write cleaner, reusable code. (do not band-aid things just because it's an intensive and needs to work in two weeks)
- Git commit more often.
- Practice safer data exchanges between the front and backend; keep those IDs safe and hack-proof.
